Follow All
==========
Follow All is an app that allows you to enter any Twitter list and then follow all the members of that list.

A (hopefully) working version of the app lives at http://follow-all.heroku.com/ and uses the following gems:

* [rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [twitter](https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter)
* [oauth](https://github.com/oauth/oauth-ruby)
